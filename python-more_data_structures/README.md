# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This project explores advanced Python data structures, focusing on sets and dictionaries. The tasks include operations like:

- Matrix manipulation
- Set operations (union, intersection, difference)
- Dictionary operations (add, modify, delete)
- Working with key-value pairs
- Using functions like map
- Converting Roman numerals to integers

Each file contains a function that solves a specific task related to Python's more complex data structures.
