Introduction:
In this project I learned that everything in Python is an object. Each object has an identity, type, and value.

id and type:
The built-in functions id() and type() help us inspect an object's identity and type. For example, id(89) returns its memory address, and type(89) returns <class 'int'>.

Mutable objects:
Mutable objects like lists can change their content. This means methods like append() can modify the object in-place.

Immutable objects:
Immutable objects like integers and strings cannot be changed after they are created. Any "modification" creates a new object.

Why does it matter:
Understanding mutability is crucial since it affects performance and behavior in functions, loops, and conditional statements. Mutable objects may lead to unexpected side effects if shared.

How arguments are passed:
Arguments in Python are passed by object reference. Thus, mutable objects can be altered within functions, while immutable objects remain unchanged unless reassigned.
