1. **Base**: The base class for all other classes in the project
2. **Rectangle**: Represents a rectangle shape
3. **Square**: Represents a square shape (inherits from Rectangle)

## Features

- Attribute validation
- Area calculation
- Display methods
- Serialization/deserialization to/from JSON
- File storage/retrieval
