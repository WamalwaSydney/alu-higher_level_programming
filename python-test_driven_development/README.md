2. **2-matrix_divided.py**: Divides all elements of a matrix by a number.
3. **3-say_my_name.py**: Prints "My name is <first name> <last name>".
4. **4-print_square.py**: Prints a square with the character `#`.
5. **5-text_indentation.py**: Prints text with 2 new lines after each `.`, `?`, or `:`.
6. **6-max_integer.py**: Finds the max integer in a list (with unittests).

## Tests

All test files are in the `tests/` directory and can be run using:

```bash
